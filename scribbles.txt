so far:
- unquoted path service ((needs no quotes at path, and spaces in the path, and write access in one of the folders)
- weak registry permissions
- weak filesystem permissions (remote mouse?)
- weak service control manager permissions (changing bin path of binary)
- 

something with replacing the temp folder with our own temp folder
